# Dnigrofasciatus_EggDiapause

This repository contains scripts used for the transcriptomic analyses in the study of maternally induced embryonic diapause in the band-legged ground cricket *Dianemobius nigrofasciatus*.

## Abstract

Embryonic diapause in *Dianemobius nigrofasciatus* is maternally programmed by photoperiod and represents one of the earliest known developmental arrest stages in insects. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of gene expression underlying diapause induction by performing RNA-seq analyses on diapause-destined and non-diapause eggs across early embryonic development. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a temporally orchestrated cascade involving chromatin remodeling, RNA processing, and metabolic reprogramming prior to morphological divergence.

This repository provides scripts used for RNA-seq quantification, differential expression analysis, clustering, and downstream functional analyses associated with this study.

## Contents

* RNA-seq quantification using Salmon

* Differential expression analysis using DESeq2

* Temporal clustering and visualization

* Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses

* Figure generation scripts used in the manuscript

## Notes on ATAC-seq analysis

ATAC-seq data processing and primary analyses were performed by Rhelixa, Inc. as a commissioned service.
Accordingly, ATAC-seq analysis pipelines are not included in this repository.

## Data Availability

* RNA-seq raw data and processed data are available from the corresponding public repositories described in the manuscript.

* Scripts used for transcriptomic analyses are provided here.
